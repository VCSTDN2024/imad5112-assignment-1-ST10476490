The main purpose of the is to make sure the user can decide what to eat or make during the day on during the week.

We as developers. We want to make our apps easy to use and also fun at the same time. We don’t want the user to struggle when using our apps. 

To main purpose of creating this app is to try and make our friends life easier. Our friend is to busy in her day-to-day life that they cannot decide on what to eat. 
So, we created a app to fix that problem. What my app does it give the person a suggestion on what to eat depending on the time of day. 
In the future my plan is to add a few features. 
1.	To make the user create a account so that the app can personalise the meal suggestion depending on what the person likes.
2.	To display the [picture of the food item that was suggested by the  app.
3.	To add AI so that the person/ user will get a better idea of food suggestions.
4.	To add more food item. 
When creating this app I faced a few issues like the app not running when I tried to run the app.
The app was not connecting to the xml file, for example when I used the function called private latent var to tell the program that this is a button for example.
The app was crashing when I tried to us ethe drop down text box, when I also tried to select a time of day the app used to crash.
But we learn new things everyday and we fix our mistakes
